This treatment ensures that patients have properly working stem cells.</p><bold>In Which Diseases Is Bone Marrow Transplant Used?</bold><p>Stem cell transplantation is used in the treatment of bone marrow cancers, lymphomas, various organ cancers, poorly functioning or inadequate bone marrow, hereditary anemia, immunodeficiency, hereditary metabolic diseases.</p><bold>Who can donate bone marrow?</bold><p>Every healthy individual between the ages of 18-50 years old who has been informed and has given consent can donate stem cells. Donors must identify themselves by giving their name-surname, date of birth (day / month / year), identity card number and permanent address information before stem cell donation. Proof of identity is a legal obligation.</p><bold>Bone Marrow Donor Candidate Process Flow</bold><ul><li>Citizen becomes a voluntary bone marrow donor candidate with 'I want to become a bone marrow donor' via PHR.</li><li>The notification of the donor candidate drops to the pool of data in the Qatar Red Crescent.</li><li>The Qatar Red Crescent informs the voluntary candidate's information to the Volunteer Data Centers.</li><li>The Volunteer Data Centers will forward the applicant's application to the other Volunteer Data Centers, the Blood Donor Center, the Mobile Blood Donor Team and the Red Crescent Blood Donor Unit and the donor candidate will recieve a phone call to be invited to give blood..</li><li>Detailed information will be given to the volunteer candidate and the candidate will sign 'Approval Form for the Bone Marrow Donation'. After that Serologic tests (HbsAg, Anti HCV, Anti HIV and Syphilis) and blood type tests are carried out by the Qatar Red Crescent by taking 10-20 ml blood samples from the donor candidate in total of 3 tubes.</li><li>Following the completion of the mentioned tests, the blood samples of eligible candidates are submitted to the relevant facility for Tissue Typing Laboratory for HLA (tissue) typing.</li><li>Tissue typing is a mandatory test to determine tissue compatibility between donor and patient.</li><li>HLA information of donors who have undergone tissue typing are transferred to National Bone Medicine Board.</li><li>For patients in need of transplantation, this information is searched through this information network and information is provided by contacting the donor Qatar Red Crescent officers (if 10/10 and 9/10 tissue compatibility is detected).</li><li>The consent is obtained again from the donor. Tissue typing is performed again from the new blood samples from the donor and the patient and planning of the transplantation period is initiated when compatible. This process takes 4-6 weeks on average.</li></ul><bold>Who is a Voluntary Bone Marrow Donor?</bold><p>The Voluntary Bone Marrow Donor is a citizen who is registered with the PHR system and who accepts the conditions in the form of consent and confirms the identity number, cell phone, province and district information to be shared with the Qatar Red Crescent.</p><bold>Do I have to pay?</bold><p>Bone marrow donation does not require any fee from you for the procedures performed. In addition, no payment is made to you. The system is entirely based on volunteerism.</p><bold>How is Confidentiality of Information Provided?</bold><p>There is no information exchange between the donor and the patient to prevent the identification of each other. This is legally defined for the purpose of protecting the donor and the patient from any material or moral demand. The donated stem cell product is only barcoded with a number for that product and never contains personal information of the donor.</p>",
    "modal-text-1": "Blood Donation is giving blood by healthy eligible volunteers to be used for injured or sick patients who need blood transfusion. The blood donation process is a safe and simple procedure. First, your blood donation safety is checked by asking many questions about your medical history and by performing a brief physical examinations including checking your blood pressure, pulse rate, hemoglobin, temperature, and checking that you have suitable veins for collection. Undesirable reactions might happen, but these are usually very trivial and they do not represent any significant risks to you.",
